# Pi Rotary Cow
Pi PICOW VOIP/SIP rotary telephone

This project used [TeleCow by ExtremeElectronics](https://github.com/ExtremeElectronics/TeleCow) as a starting point, most of the code is used from there.
If you want to create a similar project, TeleCow is probably the better starting point, as I cannot assure that I will keep this repository up to date with it.

## What it is NOT!
